## 🔧 Smart Relay Control System

A IoT-based project that controls home relays via a mobile application, RESTful API, and embedded hardware. This system includes:

- 🧠 Embedded control using **ESP32 (ESP-IDF)**
- 📱 Cross-platform mobile app built with **Flutter**
- 🌐 RESTful API in **ASP.NET Core**
- 🗃️ Backend database using **Microsoft SQL Server**
- 🔐 User authentication and profile data managed via **Firebase (Google Auth)**

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
## ESP32 (ESP-IDF)
1. Install ESP-IDF: ESP-IDF Setup Guide
2. Navigate to /esp32_firmware
3. Configure your WiFi credentials and the API URL in hardwarecode 
4. Flash the firmware:
idf.py build
idf.py -p port(COM#, COM$ etc) flash
idf.py monitor (optional)

## 🌐 ASP.NET Core API
1. Install .NET 8,9 SDK
2. Navigate to /restful_api_dotnet
3. Configure appsettings.json with your SQL Server connection string
4. Run on http

## 🗄️ SQL Server
1. Donwload Sql Server
2. Download SSMS
3. Start SSMS and copy and use that connection string in the API code

## 📱 Flutter App Setup (with Firebase)
1. Set up a Firebase project.
3. Connect it with the Flutter project.
2. Enable Google Sign-In under Firebase Auth.
3. Change the API URL in the code to enable the mobile app to fetch the hardware device.
